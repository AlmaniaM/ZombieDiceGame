Welcome to Zombie Dice!!!

The object of the game is to roll 13 brains to win. 
If you roll 3 shotguns then you loose the game.
The game comes with 13 dice, there are 6 green dice, 4 yellow dice, and 3 red dice. 
To play the game, you will need 2 people to start.
Now the first Player has to put all 13 dice in the cup and shake
it. When done, take 3 dice from the cup and roll them on to the table. 
If you have a brain, then take it and set it on the brain panel, which is on the left side.
If you have a shotgun blast, then take it and set it on the shotgun panel on the right side.
If you have a footprint, then you leave it on the table and will roll it again.  
After each roll a screen will popup and display your brains, and shotgun score. 
You can chose to either keep going or stop and score whatever brains you have. 
At the end of the game whoever has the most brains will be the winner.
